Evil Party
==========================================
Seven adventurers 

Than Shant - Son of the town drunk.  Currently sleeping in the tavern.  Not exceptionally bright, but clever.  Doesn't trust anyone.  Doesn't drink,
and is disdainful of those who do to excess.  Has no love for the town, and sees no future for himself there.  Thinking about perhaps starting
up a tavern, because there's money to be made taking advantage of idiot drunks like his father.
(Rogue)

Drunk man in the bar, raving about treasure in the graveyard.  Pays with strange gold piece that tingles.
-------------------------------------------

Mark Westin- Son ofthe local fence.  Known to the underground in the area, but strongly discouraged by his father from pursuing a rogue's path.  
Very smart, but can be naive.
(Wizard)
Unknown person fences some draconic statues, apparently golden, that tingle when touched.  Says he found them in the local
cemetary.
-------------------------------------------

Thalia Manx- Daughter of fallen paladin.  Angry at the world, bully, conniver
(Paladin)
Man comes to see father, pays him for some job that he won't mention.  She takes one of the gold
pieces, which tingles.  

-------------------------------------------
Ellemera Mend - Daughter of poacher.  Knows hunting, tracking, woodcraft.  Likes bows.  Quiet.
(Ranger)
Finds corpse in the woods, with a map of the cemetary.  Has pouch with gold that tingles.

-------------------------------------------
Hank Largo- Son of herb woman.  Knows a lot about herbs, nature, wilderness.  Likes poisons.  Angry with mother for living poor in wilderness.  
(Cleric)
Customer comes in the dead of night, looking for a poison for "rats".  Notices the cart he came in has the distinctive red clay from 
the cemetary area on the wheels.  Also notices shovels and other digging equipment.  Man is furtive, and overpays in gold, of a strange
mintage that tingles.
-------------------------------------------

Squid - bastard son of blacksmith.  Not too bright, but quite strong.  Easily frustrated, and easily lead. (Fighter)

Out of towner comes in to the shop looking to have some excavation tools repaired.  Complains that the rock out by the cemetary is very 
hard on the tools.  When asked what he's doing out there, he gets evasive, and offers to pay double if you can have the work done faster.  
Pays with tingly gold.

-------------------------------------------
Dogboy - beggar.  Filthy, ignorant, but curious.  Charming in a ragged sort of way. (Sorceror/Bard)

Out of towner tosses you a gold coin, more money than you have seen in your life.  As you bite it to see if it's real, he asks you if you
would like to earn some more of them.  Says he needs you to watch his wagon while he does some business.  You are unable to resist peeking
inside, and find some pieces of funeral urns along with a chest full of the gold pieces, and other digging supplies.  The man comes out and
tells you that he'll have more work tomorrow if you're still interested.

Items  
----------------
Greatsword - Thanak's Reaper - Neutral Evil (Fighter)
int 18, cha 18, wis 10

Forged out of the iron throne of Thanak, the first lord of the DrakVath, Thanak's Reaper is
devoted to two principles - strengthening the rule of the DrakVath, and doing it in the 
bloodiest way possible.  The sword delights in slaughter, and has no patience with diplomats
or cowards.  If a wielder pleases the sword, it will make more of its abilities available
to the wielder.  On the other hand, it will reduce its cooperation if the wielder's goals
diverge from that of the Reaper.

Shortbow - Kidney Skewer - Neutral Evil (Rogue), 
int 18, wis 18, cha 10

Crafted by an insane elven bowyer, Kidney Skewer is paranoid, sneaky, and underhanded.  It 
prefers stealth, the attack from behind, and the targeted blow.  It does not like to charge
blindly into combat, preferring to hang back and spot the weak.  It was first wielded by

long association, and works hardest when preserving their rule.

It was commissioned by Lovank, a bounty hunter and one of the lords of the DrakVath, who used it
to first hunt down and slay it's maker.  That sort of thinking appealed to Bloodfinger, who
is loyal to the cause of the DrakVath, as long as it gets used.  It will not tolerate any other
intelligent items to be used by it's wielder, and is very upset if they use another weapon with
any regularity.

int 18, wis 10, cha 18

Widow's cry derives its name from the number of battles that it has been blown in.  
It loves the clamor of the battlefield, the glory of the fight, and the sounds of
