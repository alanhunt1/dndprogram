Halt!

I have come to deliver you a warning.  Turn aside now from the dark path that you have taken up!  I could not be certain that
you were becoming what I had feared, but the evidence now is too strong to be discounted.  You reek of the evil of the DrakVath!

Do you not sense it in the weapons that you carry?  Do you not feel it in the changes that are twisting you?  Do you not cower
in the darkness of your dreams?  You are being used, and to a more vile end than you may know.

When the DrakVath were banished from this land, they did not go quietly, and the cancer of their followers was only rooted out
after many years of blood and terror.  We always suspected that their destruction was incomplete, that they had managed to retain
some presence in Zufals.  You are proof that our worst fears have been realized.  

The weapons that you bear are invested with pieces of their souls, and the marks you bear are the darkest of magics.  You are on
a road, not to victory, but to your own destruction.  The DrakVath had no love for anyone but themselves.  You are pawns, 
and you will become the gateway to usher them back into our land.  They cultivate you, prepare you, but not for your own 
ascendancy!  They will enter our world through you, and you will be destroyed utterly in the process.

If I cannot appeal to your better natures, if there is no good in you, then at least listen to the voice of self preservation! 
Throw down the instruments of evil, and flee from this place.  If you do not, we must destroy you.
