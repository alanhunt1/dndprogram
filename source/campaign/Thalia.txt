Thalia

That worthless dog was drunk again.  Thalia kicked her father's prone body as she walked through the small kitchen of their townhouse.  That was the third time this week!  Useless.  She grabbed the pitcher of ale on the counter, and drank from it while she thought about what to do for the day.  Maybe head over to the temple and shake down the bums and kids.  Nah, she had done that yesterday, and they didn't get more money again that fast.  Maybe she would head over to Hank's place, and see how that new rat poison had turned out.  It seemed pretty promising.  

Having made up her mind, she rifled her father's prone body to see if he had any money.  She reached into his purse, and pulled out some coins.  For a second, her hand felt tingly.  Strange.  She looked at the coins in her hand, and laughed.  Gold!  Where did that broken down loser get gold?  She didn't think he had seen a gold piece since he left that sissy god of his.  That's what you get for being a paladin of some shiny happy bearded freak.  She would have approved of his heresy, but he didn't sign on with a winner, he just spent his time lying around drunk, or doing low jobs for low people.  

She kicked him again on the way out the door.  Wonder where he got the money from?  She'd have to tell Hank about it.
